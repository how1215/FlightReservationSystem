##Airline Reservation System
Ootumlia Airlines runs sightseeing flights from Java Valley, the capital of
Ootumlia. The reservation system keeps track of passengers who will be flying
in specific seats on various flights, as well as people who will form the crew. For
the crew, the system needs to track what everyone does, and who supervises
whom. Ootumlia Airlines runs several daily numbered flights on a regular
schedule. Ootumlia Airlines expects to expand in the future, therefore the
system needs to be flexible; in particular, it will be adding a frequent-flier plan.
